# QuantOptimus - Trading Engine and Portfolio Optimization

QuantOptimus is a powerful trading engine and portfolio optimization project aimed at providing insights, data analysis, and automated trading strategies for stocks and cryptocurrency pairs. The project addresses the challenges and risks associated with trading in volatile markets, focusing on risk management, portfolio allocation, and data-driven decision-making.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the creation of QuantOptimus stems from personal experiences in trading futures and spot markets for cryptocurrencies. While volatility can present lucrative opportunities, it can also lead to significant losses if not well-exploited. Having started with spot trading and later transitioning to futures trading on Binance, the project founder experienced both successes and losses. However, during black swan events, a substantial portion of the portfolio was lost despite employing risk analysis and management strategies. It became clear that relying solely on historical data and risk management may not always be sufficient in the ever-changing world of crypto. Unpredictable market movements can occur, even defying historical trends.

Deeply reflecting on these experiences, the motivation behind QuantOptimus arose - to tackle the fundamental questions traders face:

1. **What stocks/cryptocurrency pairs should I trade?**
2. **What percentage of my portfolio should I allocate to each trade?**
3. **When should I enter a trade, take profits, or exit the market?**
4. **How can I automate my trades with a well-tested and robust strategy?**

Understanding these questions and developing effective solutions can greatly enhance trading performance, risk management, and profitability.
